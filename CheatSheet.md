### On ADDC environment


#### Using LogParser.exe
```
Total Application Errors by day (Live logs)
LogParser "SELECT QUANTIZE(TimeGenerated, 86400) AS Day, COUNT(*) AS [Total Errors] FROM Application WHERE EventType = 1 OR EventType = 2 GROUP BY Day ORDER BY Day ASC"



```


#### Using Poweshell
```
List Service Errors and Installation info
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{Path="system.evtx"; ID=7030,7045}

same as above but use live system logs
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{logname="system"; ID=7030,7045}

Get USB info from event logs
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{logname="system"} | Where {$_.Message -like "*USB*"}

from offline log
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{path="system.evtx"} | Where {$_.Message -like "*USB*"}
